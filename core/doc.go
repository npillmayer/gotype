/*
Package core contains lower level packages as a base for the typesetting stages.

Sub-packages of package core implement lower level functionality, which will be
imported by the higher level abstractions of the various typesetting stages.

Re-Use

Packages in core are not allowed to import packags from outside core,
except external libraries.

Packages from core may be of use for other projects.
