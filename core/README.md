Core Packages
=============

Package core contains lower level packages as a base for the typesetting stages.
Sub-packages of package core implement lower level functionality, which will be
imported by the higher level abstractions of the various typesetting stages.

**Attention**: Packages in core are not allowed to import packags from outside core,
except external libraries.
