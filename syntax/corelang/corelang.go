/*
Package corelang implements core commands for DSLs dealing with arithmetic
expressions, pairs and paths. It borrows from MetaFont/MetaPost,
as described in the accompanying ANTLR grammar file.

Language Features

This package includes functions for numerous language features common to
MetaFont-/MetaPost-derivated DSLs.

The implementation is tightly coupled to the ANTLR V4 parser generator.
ANTLR is a great tool and I see no use in being independent from it.

Lua Scripting

This package also includes the support for Lua scripting. The DSLs stemming
from this language core are Lua-enabled by default.

For further information please refer to types Scripting and LuaVarRef.
