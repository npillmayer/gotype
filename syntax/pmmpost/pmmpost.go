Package pmmpost implements an interpreter for "Poor Man's MetaPost".

This is the implementation of an interpreter for "Poor Man's MetaPost",
my variant of the MetaPost graphical language. There is an accompanying
ANTLR grammar file, which describes the features and limitations of PMMPost.
I will sometimes refer to MetaFont, the original language underlying
MetaPost, as the grammar definitions are taken from Don Knuth's grammar
description in "The METAFONTBook".

The intent of PMMPost is to produce scalable drawings.
To accomplish this, users write a PMMPost program.
A typical PMMPost looks like this (statements for drawing a triangle):

	beginfig("triangle", 1cm, 1cm);
	   pair A, B, C;
	   A:=(0,0); B:=(1cm,0); C:=(0.5cm,1cm);
	   draw A--B--C--cycle;
	endfig;

PMMPost will, depending on the backend configuration, output a picture
for each "beginfig() ... endfig"-statement in the program.
